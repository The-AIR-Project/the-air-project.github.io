# Nov 1 - Fluid Mechanics Research

- The physical prototype of AIR has been lent to the Fluid Mechanics Research Laboratory lead by Professor Serhiy Yarusevych at the University of Waterloo.

- A PhD student currently working in the research group reached out to the AIR team during Fall 2020. One of the current research topics of the group is using techniques from experimental fluid mechanics to determine the effectiveness of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIR will be used in the experimental setup to simulate a typical adult's breath within a closed indoor environment. 

 - More information about Dr.Yarusevych can be found on the
