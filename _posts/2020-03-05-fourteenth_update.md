# Mar 5 - Assembled Design - 3

- Today, we were able to assemble the rest of the electronics housing, wire the electronics (sensors, inputs, LCD, etc), and paint the design. Also, the device can now be run off a 12 V wall plug with a rated current of 3 A. The Arduino can handle a 12 V input, while the Servo maxes out at 6.8 V, so a voltage regulator is used. The up-to-date design is shown below.

- The reason the arms are not present is because unfortunately, the black paint ruins acrylic, which was a fact unknown to us. After the paint dried, the arms, spool, and other acrylic parts were cracked. Some were salvaged by using glue, but the arms will need to be laser-cut again, a significant step back. Fortunately, the wiring was able to be completed.

- Upon testing the components, the right-most potentiometer dial appears to be dysfunctional. This will be desoldered and tested individually, and replaced if necessary.
