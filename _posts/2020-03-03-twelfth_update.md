# Mar 3 - Assembled Design - 2

- At this point, the electrical housing has been printed, and the important changes to previous components (described <a href="/2020/03/01/eleventh_and_a_half_update.html">here</a>) have been made and re-manufactured.

- Tomorrow, once again, we will be heading to quite possibly our last Conestoga visit. As we learned from last time, we need to be more prepared, so we did a lot of testing today.

- Most of the issues from last time seem to be fixed, and the bag appears able to being compressed enough to hit our target volume numbers (~500 mL). The only thing that hasn't been addressed is the string connecting the arms to the spool. However, if connected carefully, it will work well enough for the Conestoga tests.
