# Mar 4 - Conestoga Visit - 3

- This was, by far, our best visit to Conestoga, and just in time. We were able to get very good volume measurements and insightful pressure measurements. The most important detail is that our device is able to hit the 500 mL target - in fact, in its current configuration, it outputs a maximum of about 560 mL of air.

- Shown below is the test lung volume indicator, displaying a reading of 500 mL.

- Luckily, we were offered to use a more accurate volume indicator, called a Wright Respirometer. Shown below is the Respirometer indicating an output of about 560 mL.

- Some interesting data came out of these tests. The volume output seems to be <i>very</i> consistent. For a given servo command, the maximum deviation of the output is about 10 mL, which is only 2% of the nominal adult volume requirement. Also, after recording volume outputs for different Servo positions, a quadratic relationship was identified for this region of operation, as shown below.

- Also worth noting is that the Servo angle of 210 degrees has been identified as a reasonable maximum angle for the Servo. Commands for the Servo to compress the bag past this angle result in a stall of the Servo, and are therefore not useful.
