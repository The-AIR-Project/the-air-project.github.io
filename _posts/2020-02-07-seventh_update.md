# Feb 7 - Conestoga Visit - Day 1

- Today we visited Conestoga College at their Respiratory Therapy lab. They had some very useful equipment to test BVM techniques, including a test lung that is capable of measuring pressure in the lungs, pressure at the mouth, and volume delivered.

- The data we gathered showed us what we need to do to improve our design. For example, even though the bag is being squeezed quite a lot, the volume of air our setup can deliver is only just over 300 mL, as opposed to a goal of 500 mL. This is due to our pressure point contacts being to focused on one location of the bag, so we will need to adjust this aspect.

- Also, the pressure delivered was quite low. Currently, the motor is being driven at 10.8 V but it's full power is 12 V. We need to acquire a full 12 V motor driver to fix this.

- Finally, we are having terrible luck with the servos. Both servos we ordered do not work as advertised. One may work just well enough to test, and figure out if it's worth ordering another one.
