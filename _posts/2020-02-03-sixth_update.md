# Feb 3 - Conestoga Respiratory Therapy

- We have contacted a representative for the <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/respiratory-therapy" target="_blank"> Respiratory Therapy Program</a> at Conestoga College's School of Health and Life Sciences, which was originally suggested to us by the doctors at SickKids hospital. They like our concept, and would be willing to allow us to come and test the design on their artificial lungs. These lungs can measure volume and pressure, which is exactly what we need.

- Once we collect the data, the system can be modelled to relate encoder position and rotational velocity to volume and pressure, respectively.

- Unfortunately, we will not be able to borrow the lungs for the symposium. But, first aid services at UW mentioned they would most likely be able to loan us a test dummy for this purpose.
