# Jan 31 - Working Concept

- To prove the compression mechanism works, a very rough prototype was constructed and fitted with a DC motor. The motor winds up a string which is attached to the strap, which compresses the bag. As can be seen in the video below, this concept was proven to works.

- The motor being used is a 12 V DC motor with a 43.7:1 gearing ratio, and includes an integrated quadrature encoder. The maximum torque of this motor is about 18 kg-cm, or about 1.76 N-m.

- Since this is a DC motor, a motor driver is required. Currently, the driver being used only supports a 10.8 V output, so the motor is not being driven at its maximum potential. A new motor driver will need to be purchased.

- We are also investigating the use of a servo motor instead. This solution would eliminate the cost of a motor driver, and the complexity of controlling a DC motor.
