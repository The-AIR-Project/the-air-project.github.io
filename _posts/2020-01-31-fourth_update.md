# Jan 31 - Working Concept

- To prove the compression mechanism works, a very rough prototype was constructed and fitted with a motor. The motor winds a string which is attached to the strap, and this squeezes the bag. As can be seen in the video below, this concept works.

- The motor being used is a DC motor with a 43.7:1 gearing ratio, runs off 12 V, and includes an integrated quadrature encoder. The maximum torque of this motor is about 18 kg-cm, or about 1.7 N-m.

- Since this is a DC motor, a motor driver is needed. Currently, it uses a driver that supports a 10.8 V output, so the motor is not being driven at its maximum potential. A new motor driver will be purchased, and a servo motor is also currently being investigated as a solution. This would eliminate the cost of a motor driver and the complexity of controlling a DC motor.
