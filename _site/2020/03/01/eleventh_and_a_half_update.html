<meta name="description" content="March 1 - Updates to Design The previous visit to Conestoga highlighted some important changes (described in the previous update) that needed to be made. Many of these design changes were made over the weekend, and will be manufactured early this week. One such change was the servo mount design. The old and new designs are compared below. Note the location of the twisting force, which is now centered over the main support leg. Additionally, a sloped guide piece has been added to the rear bag support, to allow the bag to slide in and out of the support in the case of over-compression. The updated CAD model for the design is shown below. Not shown is the new custom arms that perform the squeezing in place of the original strap. It was noticed that the design of the electrical housing / control box was going to take a lot of material and a significant amount of time to print. Therefore, it was re-designed to include more acrylic pieces, and separate 3D printed parts that will all assemble together after manufacturing. This should reduce the overall time and cost to manufacture the housing dramatically." />
