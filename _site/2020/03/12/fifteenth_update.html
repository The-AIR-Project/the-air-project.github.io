The final design for the poster that will be on display during the symposium is displayed below: This string could be easily replaced with fishing wire if required, which is convenient within developing countries. A hook was also included to attach the arms to the spool. This replaces the need to tie the string to the spool directly. It is now much faster to remove the BVM from the device and to re-attach it afterwards. Further adjustments were made existing components. Labels have been included for the buttons on the user control interface, the feet of the BVM back support have been re-printed to slide more easily, and several components were re-painted. A stand has also been included to the bottom of the device." />
