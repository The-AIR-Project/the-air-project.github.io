<meta name="description" content="Mar 3 - Assembled Design - 2 At this point, the electrical housing has been printed, and some important changes (described in the last update) have been made. Tomorrow, once again, we will be heading to quite possibly our last Conestoga visit. As we learned from last time, we need to be more prepared, so we did a lot of testing today. Most of the issues from last time seem to be fixed, and the bag appears to be being compressed enough to hit our target volume numbers (~500 mL). The only thing that hasn’t been addressed is the string connecting the arms to the spool. However, if connected carefully, it will work well enough for the Conestoga tests. The only thing missing from the above picture is the left tensioner support, the tensioner, and the arms. However, these were tested shortly after assembly and, as mentioned above, seem to work well enough for the tests tomorrow." />
