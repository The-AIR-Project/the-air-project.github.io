<p>When operating a BVM, pumping consistency is a major concern. If the technique is not performed properly throughout the duration of resuscitation, critical complications can occur, including hyperventilation [1]. It has been shown that many health care professionals lack either the skill or concentration to perform BVM resuscitation appropriately. In a study of 174 trained medical professionals, 88% of participants provided too much pressure, 73.8% delivered excessive volumes of air, and 49% performed the technique at too slow of a rate, which can cause hypoventilation [2]. Respiratory therapists at The Hospital for Sick Children revealed these inconsistencies are even more significant in high-stress situations, such as emergency paramedic dispatches.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The initial concept for AIR was generated after speaking to paramedics about their first-hand experience with various pieces of equipment. The impact this device could have on first responders has been a continuing topic of research, with our team regularly meeting with an active paramedic for vital information and advise. </div>
