# The Team
<div style="text-align: justify"> We are four Waterloo Engineering students who care about creating truly meaningful solutions to real world problems. Together, we have worked for local startups, advanced research labs at SickKids Hospital, and some of the largest companies in California. With our wide range of academic and professional experience, each of us brings our own expertise and skills to the project. This allows us to approach problems from unique viewpoints, and create the best quality solutions.

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> Originally from a small town south of Ottawa, I have always been interested in the latest toy or gadget. This interest has only grown from my time studying to be an Engineer, except the toys have gotten bigger and more expensive. </p>

<p> Most of my experience has been in product design, creating and implementing new devices and products across industries including automotive, manufacturing, and automation. This experience has taken me across Ontario and as far as California, where I had the pleasure to work for Apple on a very exciting new project. These opportunities have provided me with the analytical and hands on skills to continue to improve and apply my skills towards the cutting edge of technology. </p>

<p> At heart, I'm still a small town kid who loves snowboarding, hockey, and videogames. I still enjoy exploring the latest tech, and now I'm the one who gets to design it.

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> I’m a mechanical engineering student that’s also pursuing a minor in mathematics. The areas within engineering that I enjoy the most tend to be very mathematically intensive such as control systems, finite element methods, and autonomous robotics. </p>

<p> I’ve worked under a large variety industries throughout my co-op terms including software development, engineering simulation, factory automation, and metal tooling. I was even fortunate enough to work at Apple in California during my last co-op term, and visit China on a business trip. </p>

<p> I’ve acquired a very diverse skill set from all of my experience which includes programming, simulation, CAD, and design. I’m excited for the endeavours that await in the future.

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> Growing up in Newmarket, Ontario, I first got into technology during a couple grade 11 computer engineering courses. My teacher encouraged self-learning and ambitious projects, and I took off from there. Now, I am happy to say I have been able to apply much of what I've learned in the industry. </p>

<p> I have mainly focused on software development throughout my co-op positions. This includes robotic controls, virtual surgery simulations, and machine learning. In fact, my efforts at the Hospital for Sick Children led to the publishing of an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31897740" target="_blank">article</a> in the Journal of Medical Systems, on the use of convolutional neural networks in medicine. I have also gained experience implementing embedded software algorithms during my time at AdHawk Microsystems. </p>

<p> When I am not busy with engineering-related work, I like to go biking, play guitar, and referee hockey.

<div style="text-align: justify"> Invaluable information for the function and design of AIR was provided by consulting the Respiratory Therapy division at the Hospital for Sick Children. These in-person visits by members of our team allowed us to obtain critical knowledge from some of the worlds leading experts. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The initial concept for AIR was generated after speaking to paramedics about their first-hand experience with various pieces of equipment. The impact this device could have on first responders has been a continuing topic of research, with our team regularly meeting with an active paramedic for vital information and advise. </div>
