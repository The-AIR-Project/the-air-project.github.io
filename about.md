# Background
When operating a BVM, pumping consistency is a major concern. If the technique is not performed properly throughout the duration of resuscitation, critical complications can occur, including hyperventilation [1]. It has been shown that many health care professionals lack either the skill or concentration to perform BVM resuscitation appropriately. In a study of 174 trained medical professionals, 88% of participants provided too much pressure, 73.8% delivered excessive volumes of air, and 49% performed the technique at too slow of a rate, which can cause hypoventilation [2]. Respiratory therapists at The Hospital for Sick Children revealed these inconsistencies are even more significant in high-stress situations, such as emergency paramedic dispatches.

<div style="text-align: justify"> Invaluable information for the function and design of AIR was provided by consulting the Respiratory Therapy division at the Hospital for Sick Children. These in-person visits by members of our team allowed us to obtain critical knowledge from some of the worlds leading experts. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Recommended to us by SickKids, the Respiratory Therapy program at Conestoga College has provided us with further insights about the requirements of our design. They have also provided us with testing equipment for volume and pressure measurements which have proved to be very useful (see <a href="https://the-air-project.github.io/2020/02/07/seventh_update.html" target="_blank">here</a>). </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The initial concept for AIR was generated after speaking to paramedics about their first-hand experience with various pieces of equipment. The impact this device could have on first responders has been a continuing topic of research, with our team regularly meeting with an active paramedic for vital information and advise. </div>
