# The Team
<div style="text-align: justify"> We are four Waterloo Engineering students who care about creating truly meaningful solutions to real world problems. With a wide range of academic and professional experience, each of us brings our own expertise and skills to the project. This allows us to approach problems from unique viewpoints, and create the best quality solutions.

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> Originally from a small town south of Ottawa, I have always been interested in the latest toy or gadget. This interest has only grown from my time studying to be an Engineer, except the toys have gotten bigger and more expensive. </p>

<p> Most of my experience has been in product design, in industries from automotive, to manufacturing, to automation. This experience has taken me across Ontario and as far as California, where I had the pleasure to work for Apple on a very exciting new project. These opportunities have provided me with the analytical and hands on skills to continue to improve and apply my skills towards the cutting edge of technology. </p>

<p> From a small town kid to engineering products in California, I still love exploring the latest tech, and now I'm the one who gets to design it.

<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> Growing up in Newmarket, Ontario, I first got into technology during a couple grade 11 computer engineering courses. My teacher encouraged self-learning and ambitious projects, and I took off from there. Now, I am happy to say I have been able to apply much of what I've learned in the industry. </p>

<p> I have mainly focused on software development throughout my co-op positions. This includes robotic controls, virtual surgery simulations, and machine learning. In fact, my efforts at SickKids Hospital led to the publishing of an [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31897740) in the Journal of Medical Systems on the use of convolutional neural networks in medicine. I have also gained experience implementing embedded software algorithms during my time at AdHawk Microsystems. </p>

<p> When I am not busy with engineering-related work, I like to go biking, play guitar, and referee hockey.
