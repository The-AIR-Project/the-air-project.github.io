<div style="text-align: justify"> Recommended to us by SickKids, the Respiratory Therapy program at Conestoga College has provided us with further insights about the requirements of our design. They have also provided us with testing equipment for volume and pressure measurements which have proved to be very useful (see <a href="https://the-air-project.github.io/2020/02/07/seventh_update.html" target="_blank">here</a>). </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The initial concept for AIR was generated after speaking to paramedics about their first-hand experience with various pieces of equipment. The impact this device could have on first responders has been a continuing topic of research, with our team regularly meeting with an active paramedic for vital information and advise. </div>
